#Week 1:
- Dismath was introduced to me by discussing about basic terms
    - Proof
    - Propositions
    - Logical deduction
    - Axiom
- We were told to check our GITHUB daily
  
- Logical Connectives was taught to us:
    - Negation (¬, not)
    - Conjunction (∧, and)
    - Disjunction (∨, or)
    - Exclusive Or (⊕, xor)
    - Conditional (→, if,then)
    - Biconditional (↔, iff)
- Note: 
  - ∧ - means "and" can also be known as "multiply"
  - ∨ - means "or" can also be known as "add"

#Week 2:
- Logical Equivalences was also discussed 
    - Identity Law
    - Domination Law
    - Negation Law
    - Double Negation Law
    - Idempotent Law
    - Commutative Law
    - Associative Law
    - Distributive Law
    - De Morgan's Law
    - Absorption Law

- note: implication equivalence
  - p→q = ¬p∨q
        - We were given the Superman problem as homework. I read and analyzed the problem and my answer is that superman does not exist and the argument is valid. To be honest, I didn't quite know how to write the arguements in equation form.
        - As of January 25, 2016, I am still a bit confused on writing down the propositions and arguments. But i have the idea on how to evaluate it.
- Predicate logic was discussed. It tells us that it is concerned not only with the logic relations between sentences, but also their internal structure.
    - What i understand about this topic is that the Internal structure of the proposition itself is important.
    - This is required to understand Rules of Inference
