#Week 1:
- Dismath was introduced to me by discussing about basic terms
    - Proof
    - Propositions
    - Logical deduction
    - Axiom
- We were told to check our GITHUB daily
  
- Logical Connectives was taught to us:
    - Negation (¬, not)
    - Conjunction (∧, and)
    - Disjunction (∨, or)
    - Exclusive Or (⊕, xor)
    - Conditional (→, if,then)
    - Biconditional (↔, iff)
- Note: 
  - ∧ - means "and" can also be known as "multiply"
  - ∨ - means "or" can also be known as "add"

#Week 2:
- Logical Equivalences was also discussed 
    - Identity Law
    - Domination Law
    - Negation Law
    - Double Negation Law
    - Idempotent Law
    - Commutative Law
    - Associative Law
    - Distributive Law
    - De Morgan's Law
    - Absorption Law

- note: implication equivalence
  - p→q = ¬p∨q
  
- Predicate logic was discussed.
- It tells us that it is concerned not only with the logic relations between sentences, but also their internal structure.
    - The Internal structure of the proposition itself is important.
    - This is required to understand Rules of Inference
- Rules of Inference were taught to us.
    - argument: a sequence of statements that end with a conclusion
    - valid: the conclusion, must follow from the truth of the preceding statements, or premises, of the argument.
    - fallacy: common form of incorrect reasoning leading to invalid arguments.

#Week 3:
- We talked about the 4 methods of Proof:
    - Direct Proof
    - Proof by Contraposition (Indirect)
    - Proof by Contradiction (Indirect)
    - Proof by Equivalence 

- Direct Proof:
    - First, we assume P is true.
    - Then, we show that q is also true.
    
- Proof by Contraposition:
    - First, we assume ¬q is true.
    - Then, we show that ¬p is true.
    
- Proof by Contradiction:
    - First assume ¬p is true.
    - Then, show that ¬q is true.
    
- We also talked about the Vacaous and Trivial Proof.
- For Vacuous Proof, we show that p is false, because p→q must be true when p is false.
- For Trivial Proof, we show that q is true, it follows that p→q must also be true.

#Week 4:
- Proof by Equivalence:
    - p→q and q→p are both true.

- This week, we discussed a new lesson, Mathematical Induction.
- Mathematical Induction has two steps:
    - Basis Step
    - Inductive Step

- Recursive Algorithms:
    - an algorithm is called recursive if it solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.
